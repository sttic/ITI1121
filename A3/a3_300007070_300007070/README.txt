The goal of the assignment is to efficiently solve the "Instant Insanity" game using queue-based
breadth-first search algorithm.

For the bonus, I aimed to remove the redundant solutions by comparing the current solution
to the past solutions stored in the queue. If any orientations of the current one matches
the ones in the queue, then it would not get enqueued.

Due to time constraints, the bonus I have is half working. It follows the above laid-out logic
but only removes half of the redundant solutions.
